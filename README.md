## Docker Image

### Build image

To build image you need to execute  `docker build -t derealestatereturn:1.0 .`, where 
* -t is for tagging the image. 
* derealestatereturn is the name of the image.
* 1.0 is the tag name. If you donâ€™t add any tag, it defaults to the tag named latest.
* . (dot) at the end means, we are referring to the Dockerfile location as the docker build context. That is our current directory.

### Run docker image

Execute `docker run -p 8080:80 --name derealestatereturn:1.0` and go in browser to `http://localhost:8080/`
* -p flag for the port number, the format is local-port:container-port
* -name is a docker image name together with tag
* you can also use -d flag for running the container in detached mode
* or can use --rm to automatically remove container when it exits
